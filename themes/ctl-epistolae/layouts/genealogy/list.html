        <h2>Genealogical Resources</h2>

        <p>The genealogical tables listed below illustrate the place of  the authors in this collection in the ruling families of Europe as well as their relationships to one another.  Because of the way the tables were compiled, they may sometimes offer spellings and datings that differ slightly from those found in the main part of the database. While each the tables reflects marriages and relations across all of Latin Europe, they group roughly, in terms of the primary geographical base of the families represented, into North, South, and Outremer.  Tables 1 and 2 trace descent from Charlemagne and Henry the Fowler and provide fairly full representation of the ruling houses of England, the Low Countries, France, Germany, Bohemia, Hungary, and Poland.  Tables 3 through 6 provide  representation for Aragon, Barcelona, Provence, Toulouse, and Savoy. Table 7  focuses on the Crusader kingdom of Jerusalem. (Note that item 2.4 in that list does not link to a table but merely serves to group the three lines below it together.)</p>

        <p>Hyperlinks on those pages link to the author pages for the highlighted individuals. A "see also" note at the beginning of the biography of each of those women indicates the charts on which they appear, and clicking on those hyperlinked numbers takes one directly to the first place in which they appear on each of those tables. (Unfortunately, because of the way the tables display on the screen, you may not always be taken directly to the precise location. In such cases you can find the individual by pressing Ctrl-f on a Windows machine or command-f on a Mac, typing the first few letters of the name and pressing Enter. You can then move through the hits to find the proper person.)</p>

        <p>In the tables, a plus sign (+) denotes a marriage, a vertical line (|) a line of descent from a person or pair, and horizontal dashes (---) the children of a particular line. In cases where an individual has multiple marriages with a significant number of descendants from each, it is sometimes necessary to scroll far down below the first line of descent before the additional spouse and their offspring are encountered. Where an individual appears more than once in the table, a double asterisk (\*\*) enables one to jump to the next instance in the table, and eventually to cycle back to the first instance. (If this does not work, because of the way the table displays on the screen, just press Ctrl-f or command-f, enter the name as it appears next to the (\*\*), and press Enter.)</p>
